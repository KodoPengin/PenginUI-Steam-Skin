# GameIndustry: PenginUI - A custom Steam style
This unique Steam style is my own one and was released to the public.

It's a WIP project and only updated irregularly

# Special features:
- Removed a lot advertising (e.g. banner, events, endless scrolling) and unnecessary elements on the Steam mainpage, shopping cart, search, product sites and other subcategories
- Removed background pictures
- Color overhaul (work in progress)
- Some library changes ( e.g. stopped animations, removed broadcasting), removed backgrounds and some graphics
- Added additional Menu items to the header
- Complete profile overhaul with transparency and fixed background

Adjustments to the code took a lot of time and effort. If the files (or components) are from somewhere else (maybe modified), they are not from me and get no support.
