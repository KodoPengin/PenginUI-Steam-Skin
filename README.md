# PenginUI - A custom Steam style
This unique Steam style is my own one and was released to the public.

It's a <b>WIP project</b> and only updated irregularly. Deal with it ;]

# Special features:
- Removed a lot advertising (e.g. banner, events, endless scrolling) and unnecessary elements on the Steam mainpage, shopping cart, search, product sites and other subcategories
- Removed background pictures
- Color overhaul (work in progress)
- Some Steam-library theme changes ( e.g. stopped animations, removed broadcasting), removed backgrounds and some graphics
- Added additional Menu items to the header
- Complete Steam profile overhaul with transparency and fixed backgrounds
- Additional Batch Script to delete Spyware and Crashlytics from Steam game folders
- Lightweight theme changes, no bloatware, no third party software required

# Installation & readme
- Copy the whole content into your Steam folder
- In Steam go to Settings/Interface and select PenginUI from the dropdown menu
- Restart the client
