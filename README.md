This unique Steam style is my own one and was released to the public.

# Special features:
- Removed a lot advertising and unnecessary elements on the main page, product sites and other subcategories on Steam
- Removed background pictures
- Color overhaul (work in progress)
- Some library changes like stopped some animations, removed backgrounds
- Added additional Menu items to the header

# Copyright, Support & License
Adjustments to the code took a lot of time and effort. If the files (or components) are from somewhere else (maybe modified), they are not from me and get no support.
