--------------------------

The included file "del_u3a.bat" scans the standard Steam-folder for "UnityCrashHandler64.exe" and "UnityCrashHandler32.exe" and deletes them from the respective game directories.
Thus preventing the hidden data mining and sending of Crashlytics by Unity Technologies, ApS and increasing your privacy during your game sessions.
