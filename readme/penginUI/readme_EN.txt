#### Short Description ####
Unique Steam style. Focus was placed on eliminating unnecessary functions and advertising on the current Steam layout to deliver a minimalistic and clean UI.

#### Latest Changes ####
Additions to the Autumn Sale 2020

#### Installation ####

Open Steam folder
Copy the whole archive content into the installation folder of Steam

The steam.cfg must be in the root folder of Steam. It tells the client not to update itself, otherwise the adjustments of the included libaryroot.css will be lost each time.

If you want to update the Steam client, you have to delete/rename, update and then reactivate the steam.cfg and insert the libraryroot.css again. Or ignore the library changes. They are optional.

Open the Steamclient
Settings -> Interface -> Select the name PenginUI from the list and confirm
Restart Steam
finished

#### Optional ####
Optional folder contains some library adjustments which can be used by own preferences

#### Already an own skin in use? ####
No problem. The webkit.css from *PenginUI\resource folder can be used too or use as alternative single passsages from my guide/webkit.css for own needs. Make sure to make a backup of an already existing file before.
